# Custom-Lisp
This Project Follows the guide of "Build your own Lisp" and therefore only used for educational/training purposes. This is also used to become acustom to using git/github-cli.

For the sake of some orginization and due to the nature of the guide the actual working Lisp will be in it own folder while excersizes and experaments done from the book will be in a diffrent folder. All of this will be reorganized at a later time.
